# FrontEnd Development Libraries 


## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a front end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development, and includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality.

In this course, you'll learn how to build responsive websites with Bootstrap, and use its included classes to style buttons, images, forms, navigation, and other common elements.


## jQuery

jQuery is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in the world.

In 2006 when it was released, all major browsers handled JavaScript slightly differently. jQuery simplified the process of writing client-side JavaScript, and also ensured that your code worked the same way in all browsers.

In this course, you'll learn how to use jQuery to select, remove, clone, and modify different elements on the page.
